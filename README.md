# ML-Metrics-Evaluation

A simple Python project demonstrating key classification metrics (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score) and confusion matrix visualization using logistic regression on the breast cancer dataset.

## Project Overview

This project shows how to evaluate the performance of a binary classification model using popular metrics and visualize the confusion matrix with seaborn and matplotlib. The breast cancer dataset from `sklearn.datasets` is used for demonstration.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
